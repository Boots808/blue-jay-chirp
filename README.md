#Challenge 1 - blue-jay-chirp Repository

## Updated the clients web per their submitted update requests

- My motivation was to fulfill the clients request and provide an updated web page as described 
- I made the changes and updates to this project as requested to better their website including debugging and accessability
- It solved their bug issues and provided better semantic layouts between the sheets of codes and comments for easier readability and editing in the future
- I learned that I struggle with how to lay content side by side

##There are no steps to install this project

##Usage - This website can be accessed by the user to reach out to the company Horiseon for their SEO needs. They can use the navigation bar to jump to different parts of the web page as needed to read more about the offering. 

The client can use the CSS and HTML sheets as they further work on their web page and make updates as needed. 

#Road Map - The index.html will need to be updated in the near future to allow the content to be aligned on the page. 

#License for this web page belongs to the Horiseon company
